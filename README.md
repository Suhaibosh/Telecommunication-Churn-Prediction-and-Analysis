# Telecommunication-Churn-Prediction-and-Analysis
Project involves preprocessing and analyzing customer data to predict churn. The project utilizes various machine learning techniques, including LinearSVC and Logistic Regression, for binary classification. It includes data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, normalization, and model evaluation.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling duplicates and incorrect data entries
   - Managing missing values and null data
   - Data type conversion for optimization
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalizing and scaling numerical features

2. **Modeling**:
   - LinearSVC and Logistic Regression models
   - Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Cross-validation for robust model performance comparison

3. **Visualization**:
   - Bar and box plots to visualize trends and distributions

## Data Overview

The dataset consists of customer information such as:
- **Customer ID (CO_ID)**
- **User (USER_CREATED_BY)**
- **Phone Number (MSISDN)**
- **Plan Details (Plan_Name)**
- **Customer Tenure and Status**
- **Churn Flag** (Target variable)
- **Customer Interaction Score and Loyalty Points**

- **Evaluation Metrics**

    Accuracy
    Precision
    Recall
    F1 Score
